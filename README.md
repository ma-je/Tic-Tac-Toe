I approached the project by first reviewing all of the requirements for the app. I used the requirements to help construct some user stories. Some examples include:
  *Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select - if I had time, I would have like to use pictures instead of letters X and O. The plan was to get game functional and then come back to do this, however, didn't have enough time
  *As a user ,when I click a square I want to see X or O
  * As a user, I want to be able to sign in
  * As a user, I want to be able to sign up
  * As a user, I want to be able to change the password
  * As an administrator, I want to be able to see that a password has been
   reset

As a beginning developer, I found this project challenging for several reasons including the fact that I didn't feel comfortable with my level of knowledge of the various concepts/constructs involved in executing the project. Balancing the time between reviewing materials covered in class for deeper comprehension and working on the project posed a significant challenge. I tried writing the steps to the game in English - pseudocode - often. The game logic is clunky at the moment. I'd like to come back, once I have better grasp of functions, to break it down into more manageable (modular) components.

I began with the wireframes, which shifted considerably from conception to final product. I started by playing the game on paper to simulate user experience. This helped me to think about the various data structures that I could use. I got stuck at various stages of the project and consulted a number of resources (class materials, google, books, consultants, and classmates). Utlizing open source information to learn from, I utilized these resources to help me construct codes that I understand and can explain, given my current level of knowledge. I intend to return to this project to improve the code as I gain more knowledge and experience using the concepts involved.

I used the browser template provided by General Assembly, Boston as part of the technologies used to complete this project. The link to the wireframes can be found here (insert link here). The game url can be found here.

Working on this project helped me to understand the concepts covered in class and in the readings. It's a good learning experience.
